Most the this ceramics can be assigned to the Teuchitlan tradition and probably come from shaft tombs built below houses. Recent excavations reveal that ceramic figures, ceramic vessels, shell ornaments, polished stone axes, and obsidian implements all could be included as offerings in shaft tombs. It is likely that only members of elite families, both men and women, were buried in these kinds of tombs.

Many of these objectsare human figures, others are vessels shaped to resemble plants and animals. Human figures help archaeologists understand how people wore nose rings, earrings, armbands, and other personal adornments. Other artifacts provide clues about cultural practices. For example, figures such as (1) have swollen cheeks, possibly representing scarred and healing cuts from cheek piercing that was ritually carried out to mourn deceased family members.

Some ceramics show groups of people engaged in activities. Objects (4) and (5) both show people and animals seated outside of residences. Kristi Butterwick has suggested that figures like (4) may depict mortuary feasts. The upper level of the sculpture represents people engaged in feasting and food preparation activities while the lower chamber shows slumped figures that may represent deceased family members. Dr. Butterwick proposes that the birds perched next to the house represent souls of the dead who have yet to descend to the underworld.
