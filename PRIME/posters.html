<h1>Participants and Poster presenters</h1>

<h4>Dr Shonil Bhagwat</h4>
<h5>Senior Lecturer in Geography, The Open University, UK</h5>

<p><b>Bio:</b> I am an interdisciplinary environmental geographer with background in natural and social sciences. My research has examined the resilience of ecosystems to long-term changes spanning decades and centuries and my fieldwork over the last 15 years has been located in a number of developing countries in South and South-east Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. In PRiME project, I am interested in conceptual understandings of resilience and applying those to major emergencies: What configurations of system components (institutions, infrastructure, technologies) are most effective in building resilience to sudden environmental hazards? 

<p><b>Abstract: </b> Resilience has become a buzz-word in the fields as diverse as economics, environment, engineering, health, psychology, politics, sociology and many others. Does the resilience of things and of people have the same characteristics? The modern-day political apparati strive to make people, communities and societies resilient. Does this top-down approach undermine people's creativity to respond to crisis situations? The metaphor of bouncing back aspires to return to the pre-crisis state. Does this stymie potentially new solutions that people might come up with through their sheer creativity? Do technologies assist people in the process of reassembly? How do social interdependencies help in rebuilding the structures on which the smooth-running of people's everyday lives depends? I am interested in the discussion and debate on the notion of posthuman resilience in the context of emergencies and understand what it means to be resilient in a post-human world when a disaster strikes. 

<h4>Dr. Youngok Choi</h4>
<h5>Senior Lecturer in Design, College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences, Brunel University London</h5> 
<p><b>Bio:</b> My research focuses on the strategic use of design to solve social problems/issues considering how to create and/or deliver social values through design, i.e. design's contribution to society. It would therefore be a great opportunity for me to bring my knowledge and experiences in design strategy development to the recovery of the difficulties resulted from major emergencies including natural disasters.</p>

<h4>Dr. Sungwoo Lim</h4>  
<h5>Lecturer in Design, School of Engineering and Innovation, The Open University</h5> 
<p><b>Bio:</b> My main research is to develop extra-terrestrial construction process using 3D printing technology on other planetary bodies including the Moon and Mars. PRiME project seems a good terrestrial application of my research, thus I am interested in how the appropriate technology and In-Situ resource utilisation improve the second level response (short- and long-term recovery mode).  
  
<p><b>Abstract:</b> MISSION (Multidisciplinary Investigation of System using Sintering Instrumentation Of the Next generation) is an interdisciplinary research aims to understand potential extra-terrestrial construction processes both theoretically and practically, which will support the ESA's human exploration strategy to the Moon as a stepping-stone to Mars exploration. This groundbreaking research would usher in a new era of Built Environment technology, which changes the current paradigm of Built Environment culture, and will address important challenges of construction processes in an extra-terrestrial environment - particularly on the Moon and Mars - and develop an appropriate 3D Printing based robotic construction process.  
 
<h4>Gemma Maldar</h4>
<h5>Senior Manager Research Development, The Open University</h5>

<h4>Dr. Geraint Morgan</h4> 
<h5>Business Development Manager, The Open University, School of Physical Sciences</h5> 
<p><b>Bio:</b> I lead the space technology transfer agenda in the School of Physical Sciences and as an analytical chemist I am interested in how the solutions and know-how developed for missions such as Rosetta and Beagle2 can be applied to challenges back here on Earth.  We have provided solutions to a range of sectors; including healthcare, forensic science, flavours and fragrances and environmental monitoring. These have included an award winning air monitoring system for use on future UK submarines and a sector disruptive technology to be used by perfumers in Paris.  I also have two companies funded by ESA at their Business Incubation Centre in Harwell and I have strategic partnerships with over a dozen commercial companies, with a view to developing new analytical methods or field portable products. My interest in the PRiME project comes from applying and procedures to terrestrial problems. <p><b>Abstract: </b> Planetary exploration pushes the boundaries of science and technology - many of these "out of the box" solutions may have applications in hazardous environments here on Earth. I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of field deployable detectors, both in a planetary exploration and in a terrestrial search-and-rescue situation. My poster will showcase selected terrestrial applications of our space technology and detectors to a range of sectors.

<h4>Dr Paul Piwek</h4> 
<h5>Senior Lecturer in Computing, School of Computing and Communications, The Open University, UK</h5> 
<p><b>Bio:</b> I investigate computational models of language use and gestures. I focus on algorithms for the automatic generation of language from data and text. My work includes studies into the expression of affect, pointing gestures and non-cooperation in dialogue. I am also leading research on the automatic generation of questions from text.  
Emergency scenarios, such as those considered for PRiME, involve collaboration and interaction between human actors and, increasingly, autonomous technologies, including robots.  
I am interested in: (1) using theories and tools from the area of computational linguistics to study communication in emergency scenarios and (2) applying language generation algorithms to facilitate the interaction between people and technologies in emergency scenarios. 

<p><b>Abstract:</b> My poster briefly summarizes a range of topics in language generation, including affective language generation, generation of language and gestures and non-cooperative dialogue. These are intended as exemplifying research in language generation with possible applications to emergency scenarios.  
  
<h4>Dr. Susanne P. Schwenzer</h4> 
<h5>Lecturer in Earth Sciences, The Open University, School of Environment, Earth and Ecosystem Sciences</h5> 

<p><b>Bio:</b> I am a lecturer in Earth sciences and thus interested in how geologic events impact on infrastructure and society. My main research, however, is in planetary science and I am part of the Curiosity rover mission to Mars. My interest in the PRiME project comes from applying space technology and procedures to terrestrial problems. 

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Space exploration has developed sophisticated routines for remote operations - and on Earth many robotics applications are developed to operate remotely in hazardous environments. I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of remote operations, both in a planetary exploration and in a terrestrial search-and-rescue situation. My poster will showcase selected terrestrial applications of robotics in emergency situations as they are developed around the world. Part of this work was done by Sarah Gent and Verity Bennett during their work experience at the OU.
