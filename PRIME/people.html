<div id="shonilToggle" style="display: none"><p>is Senior Lecturer in Geography at the Open University. Before joining The Open University as Lecturer in Geography in 2013, he directed an international and interdisciplinary masters programme at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, UK (2009-2013). He has also held post-doctoral research appointments at the University of Oxford (2006-2009) and at the Natural History Museum, London, UK (2003-2006) after gaining a DPhil (PhD) from the University of Oxford in 2002. His current research centres on the linkages between environment and development. It addresses these linkages through the conceptualisation of social-environmental systems. His research addresses the resilience of these systems within the context of growing discussion on the Anthropocene, the age of humans.</p></div>

<p><b>Dr Paul L.A. Piwek</b> <a id="displayPaul" href="javascript:toggle('displayPaul','togglePaul');">more info</a>
<div id="togglePaul" style="display: none"><p>is Senior Lecturer in Computing at the Open University. He has participated in research projects in a range of domains from transport to social media and assistive technologies. He conducts theoretical, empirical and applied research into how people process information and how algorithms can convert information from one modality to another (e.g., take text and turn it into a dialogue, or take data/concepts and turn them into text with images), in order to help people understand and engage with the information. He has led several projects at the Open University, with funding from the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), and the eSTEeM initiative.</p></div>
