<p><b>David Roden, <i>Posthumanism and the Ethics of Resilience</i></b> <a id="rodenDisplay" href="javascript:toggle('rodenDisplay','rodenToggle');">abstract and bio</a>
<div id="rodenToggle" style="display: none">
<p><b>abstract: </b>This talk aims, firstly, to provide an account of the main forms of posthumanism; secondly, to explore some of their implications for our understanding of resilience. A philosophy is humanist - more properly "anthropocentric" - if gives humans a privileged status. The bottom line for all posthumanisms is the rejection of anthropocentrism; though this rejection takes different forms in ethics, epistemology and futurism. I go on to distinguish posthumanism in its critical and futurist (or speculative) forms, exploring their connections to related ideas like human enhancement (transhumanism), realism and naturalism. I end on two questions that posthumanists should ask of resilience: whether resilience is an anthropocentric notion connected with "human" ways of interpreting the world, and whether resilience can be a coherent social goal in conditions of technological modernity. 


<p><b>bio: </b>He has worked as a Lecturer and Associate Lecturer in Philosophy at the Open University. He is author of Posthuman Life: Philosophy at the Edge of the Human (published by Routledge 2014). His research has addressed posthumanism, philosophical naturalism, cyberculture, deconstruction, the metaphysics of computer music and new realism.

<p><b>bio: </b>Ivana Kruijff-Korbayova holds a degree in Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University (1992) and a PhD in mathematical linguistics, Charles University (1998), Czech Republic. Before joining DFKI Saarbruecken (2008) she had a research fellowship at the University of Edinburgh and then worked at the Saarland University. Her research addresses discourse and dialogue modelling and context-sensitive natural language processing for dialogue systems and human-robot interaction. She has over 70 peer-reviewed publications and has lead numerous projects.

<div id="toggleInger" style="display: none">
<p>
<b>abstract: </b>The large earthquakes that hit Nepal in spring 2015 disturbed and destroyed both urban and rural infrastructure. We investigate post-disaster resilience in traditional and more modernized farming communities in one of the epicentres. Responses must be seen in light of the on-going agroecological transition and other globalization processes like migration. 
<p><b>bio: </b>Inger Elisabeth Maren is Assistant Professor at the
Department of Geography, University of Bergen, Norway. Her research focuses on the dynamics in coupled human and natural systems, including natural resource management, agro-biodiversity, sustainable land use, ecosystem services, and food security. She works with colleagues across the social and natural sciences to elucidate links between anthropogenic activities and the environment, in Europe, as well as in Asia, North-America and Africa.</p></div>

<b>bio: </b>Gyorgy Surjan is a senior advisor in health informatics at National Health Services Center in Hungary, and part time lecturer at Semmelweis University. He graduated as physician.

<b>abstract: </b>Managing and maintaining industrial assets such as underground utility tunnels and obsolete nuclear facilities is a complex task. The resilience of these assets both now and in the future relies on detailed condition knowledge. Historically, human actors have gathered data used for survey but often the target environments are dangerous with poor access resulting in limited data sets, poor coverage and subjective assessments. The process is expensive given the need to minimize risk to life during data acquisition. During extreme events it may not be possible to use human centric approaches. Recent advances in autonomy for space and terrestrial robotics is paving the way for autonomous robots to gather survey data consistently and over a greater area which in turn is providing users with rich information products which detail the condition of the asset or a live disaster situation thereby enabling greater overall resilience. 

<p><b>bio: </b>I conduct R&D in autonomy and robotics for space and non-space applications. I am working on the European Space Agency's (ESA) ExoMars rover and addressing several terrestrial applications where robots and autonomous systems are being used in dangerous environments. My interest in PRIME comes from the potential application of this type of technology to preventative and live responses to future events such as disasters and emergencies and more widely to understand the potential for human/technology collaboration. </p></div>
