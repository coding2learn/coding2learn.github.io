<P>The study of conversation is notoriously difficult, because naturally
occurring conversations take place against the rich background of virtually
every aspect of human existence. A theory of conversations will therefore
inevitably have its shortcomings. For instance, in this book the focus
is entirely on <I>information exchange</I> in conversations. No attention
is paid to the atmosphere in which a conversation is conducted (e.g., hostile
or friendly), ethical considerations (honesty, truthfulness), etc.
<P>There is still an abundant background that needs to be taken into account,
even if we narrow down our attention to information exchange in conversations.
Utterances depend on the context for their interpretation and also change
the context. In this respect, conversations are very similar to common
board games such as chess. Utterances bear a likeness to the moves in such
a game; a move in chess changes the context (i.e., the distribution of
the chess pieces on the board) and is at the same time dependent on the
context for its interpretation. A move of a particular piece from, say,
square A1 to A3, will in some contexts be interpreted as beating another
piece, in other contexts as checkmate, etc.
<P>We have exploited the aforementioned resemblance by modelling conversation
as a conversational game. In order to specify a conversational game, we
needed to say what its contexts, i.e., conversational states, are and what
the rules are that govern the interpretation of moves and the update of
the conversational states.
<P>We assume that an important principle governing conversational games
is the quest for a consistent conversational state. This hypothesis legitimizes
the use of a formal system of logic to model conversational states. Consistency
is one of the basic notions of logic. The particular formal system that
we chose to employ is Pure Type Systems (PTS).
<P>PTS was chosen for several reasons. Most important are the
following three. Firstly, it can be seen as a higher-order
generalization of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT). DRT has proven
to be very succesful for modelling anaphora. Anaphora play a key role in
information exchange by means of natural language. Secondly, a PTS allows
a formalization of conversational states that can be processed by a computer.
Thirdly, in PTS proofs for propositions are explicitly represented. These
proofs can employed for consistency maintenance of contexts. In particular,
they can be used to locate the information that gave rise to an inconsistency.
<P>PTS is introduced in part I. We exploit the similarities between DRT
and PTS to explain the basic notions of PTS. Subsequently, we extend PTS
with a framework for reasoning about normal objects. In particular, the
extension allows for derivation of a conclusion about an object on the
basis of the assumption that the object is a normal object of its kind.
We demonstrate that the extension covers several forms of default reasoning.
The underlying motivation for our attention to this subject is the fact
that in daily life jumping to conclusions on the basis of the assumption
that everything is normal is the rule rather than the exception.
<P>In part II, the formal tools that have been introduced in part I are
applied to three different areas in the study of conversation: <I>presupposition</I>,
<I>answerhood</I>
and <I>accent</I>. We demonstrate that these apparently different phenomena
can be modelled along similar lines. The notion of an informational gap
plays a key role.&nbsp;
<P>The chapter on presuppositions provides a deductive framework for modelling
the influence of world knowledge on presuppositions. We address the projection
of presuppositions in conditionals and disjunctions, and supply an account
of the so-called bridging examples. We report on a small observational
study which supports our hypothesis that the quest for consistency might
sometimes provide a good explanation for phenomena in the realm of presupposition
resolution that have been linked to such intractable notions as `relevance'.
<P>Our account of answerhood provides a proof-theoretic characterization
of a variety of answers (indirect answers, negative answers, preventive
answers, etc.). We show that our approach brings together the theories
that start from the idea that answerhood should be explicated in terms
of the possibility to <I>unify</I> a question and its answer and those
theories that deal with the<I> dynamic</I> and <I>contextual side</I> of
answerhood.
<P>In the chapter on accents, we provide an account of accents which covers
both contrastive accent (e.g., `The children were taken to the circus.
The <B>small</B> children enjoyed it' implicates that <I>it is not the
case that the `non-small' children enjoyed it</I> and newness accent.&nbsp;
<P>In part III, we examine longer stretches of conversation. The aim is
to explain the patterns that such stretches exhibit in terms of an underlying
model of changes to the conversational state. We propose some simple rules
for updating the conversational state in the course of a conversation.
We show that our system can be used to model a range of conversational
structures that have been reported by conversation and discourse analyst.
In particular, our account provides an incremental account of subdialogues,
as opposed to the mainly non-incremental accounts from the literature and
deals with the satisfaction of presuppositions in conversations.
<P>Finally, the problem of conveyed meanings is addressed. The conveyed
meaning of an utterance is the information that is communicated by means
of the utterance without being literally said.&nbsp; We defend the distinction
between literal and conveyed meaning and account for the relation between
conveyed meaning, in particular the conveyed meaning which is associated
with so-called indirect speech acts, and literal meaning in terms of a
system of defeasible rules of thumb. We show that a simple system of such
rules can account for a wide range of conveyed meanings.
<P>In short, in this dissertation a number of problems concerning the meaning
and use of utterances in conversations are addressed in detail. We show
that the proposals that we put forward improve on the current state of
the art in the literature. At the same time, we have tried to reveal to
some extent the unity which underlies the different topics that are addressed.
