"<a href="https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/content/courses/id31.html">Introducing Dialogue Games</a>" by Paul Piwek and Rodger Kibble at the 19th European Summer School in Logic, Language and Information (<a href="https://www.cs.tcd.ie/esslli2007/">ESSLLI2007</a>). 

<p><b>Description:</b> Analysis and modelling of dialogue poses challenges for many disciplines represented at ESSLLI including rational agency, multi-agent logics, knowledge representation and automated reasoning, statistical techniques, formal grammars, etc. In this tutorial, formal and computational approaches to dialogue are dealt with from the perspective of the unifying notion of a dialogue game. Day 1 is dedicated to introducing this notion, providing some historical background and methodological assumptions. The theme of days 2 and 3 is public commitment in dialogue as an alternative to private intentions and beliefs. On days 4 and 5, the focus is shifted to the structures (such as adjacency pairs and insertion sequences) that emerge when two or more autonomous interlocutors engage in a dialogue game. Basic knowledge of propositional and predicate logic is required to follow this tutorial.
