<h2>Project information</h2>

<p>This PhD research project will be in the context of an ongoing collaboration between the NLP/Software Engineering teams at the Open University and the Speech Technology Group at Toshiba Europe. It is funded by an EPSRC doctoral training partnership grant and Toshiba Europe. 

<p>The project will involve investigating and developing an AI buddy/dialogue system for pair programming, which can collaborate with a software developer on solving a programming problem (either from scratch or by completing a skeleton program). 

<p>A distinctive aspect of the project will be the exploration of multimodal communication by the AI buddy, specifically voice in combination with screen (text/code and mouse pointer) interaction. The project will make use of data on multimodal pair programming interactions and aim to collect additional corpus data. The project budget includes significant separate funding for data collection and annotation (i.e. remuneration of participants and annotators).
